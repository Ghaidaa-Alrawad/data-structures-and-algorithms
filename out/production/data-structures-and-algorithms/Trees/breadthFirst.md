## Approach & Efficiency

- The approach used is a typical Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- It starts from the root of the tree and explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.
- A queue data structure is used to keep track of nodes at each level.
- The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree, as it visits each node exactly once.
