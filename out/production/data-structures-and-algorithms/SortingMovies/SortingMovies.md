# Sorting Movies

Sorting an array of Movie objects based on two criteria: first, by the most recent year, and second, alphabetically by title while ignoring common prefixes ("A", "An", "The"). It uses two custom comparator functions for sorting and provides a sample array of movies to demonstrate the sorting results.
